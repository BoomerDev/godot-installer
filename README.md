# godot-installer - CLI tool to install the Godot Engine

This is a simple script I wrote to easily install the Godot Engine globally on Linux. It downloads the specified version of the Godot Engine and puts the
program into `/usr/bin/`
<br>

I also wrote a seperate script for Godot 4.0, since the directory structure for downloading is a bit different; so for now, use the godot4_installer.py script.

## Example
```
sudo python3 godot_installer.py
> Please specify the version of Godot Engine that you would like to download: '3.5.1'
```
